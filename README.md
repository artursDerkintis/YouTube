Simple YouTube client for iPads with PiP feature

With new version of YouTube app I was really disapointed that they dont feature PiP. And the design is lazy too.

I decided to my own YouTube client.

It looks like this.

#License

You can freely clone it and use it on your iPad.
But DON'T sumbit it to App Store, or I'll look for you, I will find you, and you know how it goes!
